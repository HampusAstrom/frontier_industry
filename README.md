forestry: Each area can sustain a certain maximum amount of forest (maybe it can vary dependent on forest type later as well (within the same area)). Growth is mostly ?linear? when available area is abundant, but decreases with area saturation. Competes with land usage for farming mostly. Land type and climate can be important here.

mining: Each area has a list deposits that are progressively more difficult to find. Found by prospecting, and when found are added to the total amount of exploitable material of a certain resource. Number of relevant resources is tbd. For now all found deposits are as easy to exploit, given that they can be found.

farming: More dependent on soil, climate and water availability than forestry. Does not spread on it's own, without labour.
